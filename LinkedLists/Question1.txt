Write the pseudocode for an algorithm that will remove all of the numbers from a
list that are multiples of 10. Analyze its asymptotic complexity.



while current element is not sentinel:
    if current element is divisible by 10:
        erase current element (which means modifying a next & previous pointer,
                                and freeing memory allocated by the current element)
    else:
        set current element to next




Algorithmic complexity:
    going through a linked list of n elements is an order n operation. checking
    if it is divisible by 10 is an order 1 operation. erasing an element completes
    several order 1 operations, so overall the algorithm is of order n.
