Modify the pseudocode for vector instead of linked list.


for each element in vector:
    if element is divisible by 10:
        erase current element (which means remove the current element, and shift
                                all elements around)








Algorithmic complexity:
    iterating through a vector of size n is an order n operation. checking if it is
    divisible by 10 is an order 1 operation. if this check passes, the erase operation
    is an order n operation because it must shift order n elements around following
    the deletion of the element. This makes the overall complexity of the algorithm
    order n^2.
