1. When we fail to find a value with the search() or remove() methods of a BST,
    we do not need to look elsewhere in the tree for the value. This is due to
    the nature of BSTs. By finding an empty node, it means that the value is nowhere
    in the tree. This is because each time you eliminate a subtree, it knows that
    the value you are looking for is NOT in the other subtree, so if the value
    isn't found in the remaining subtree, the value is not in the tree at all.
